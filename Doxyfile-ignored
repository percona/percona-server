# Doxygen multiline error messages.
#
# Doxygen can print errors in multiple lines:
# the first line contains the file path, line number, and error message
# subsequent lines contains additional information.
#
# Ignore rules are based on the first line only (with a path),
# so that subsequent lines are silenced here from tofix-regressions.log.
#
# To read a full error message, read tofix-all.log.
