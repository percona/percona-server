About HandlerSocket

Handlersocket is a NoSQL plugin for MySQL. It works as a daemon inside the
mysqld process, accept tcp connections, and execute requests from clients.
Handlersocket does not support SQL queries. Instead, it supports simple CRUD
operations on tables.

Because of the following reasons, handlersocket is much faster than the
mysqld/libmysql pair in some circumstances:

  - Handlersocket manipulates data without parsing SQL, which causes less
    CPU usage.
  - Handlersocket reads many requests from clients and executes their
    requests in bulk, which causes less CPU and disk usage.
  - Handlersocket client/server protocol is more compact than the 
    mysql/libmysql pair, which causes less network usage.

The current version of handlersocket only works with GNU/Linux. There are
a c++ and a perl library for handlersocket clients.

See documentation files under docs-en/ (docs-ja/) for details.
