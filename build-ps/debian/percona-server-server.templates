Default: false
Description: Remove data directories ?
 This operation will remove the data directory at '/var/lib/mysql' that stores all the databases, tables and related meta-data.
 Additionally, any import or export files stored at '/var/lib/mysql-files' will be removed along with directory, as well as the contents of
 /var/lib/mysql-keyring.

Type: note
Description: Data directory found when no Percona Server package is installed
 A data directory '/var/lib/mysql' is present on this system when no MySQL server

 server package received from third-party vendors. It may also be an unclaimed data
 directory from previous removal of mysql packages.

 It is highly recommended to take data backup. If you have not done so, now would be
 the time to take backup in another shell. Once completed, press 'Ok' to continue.

Template: percona-server-server/default-auth-override
Type: select
Choices: Use Strong Password Encryption (RECOMMENDED), Use Legacy Authentication Method (Retain MySQL 5.x Compatibility)
Description: Select default authentication plugin
 MySQL 8 uses a new authentication based on improved SHA256-based password methods. It is recommended that all new MySQL Server installations use this method going forward.
 This new authentication plugin requires new versions of connectors and clients, with support for this new 8 authentication (caching_sha2_password).
 Currently MySQL 8 Connectors and community drivers built with libmysqlclient21 support this new method. Clients built with older versions of libmysqlclient may not be able
 to connect to the new server.
 .
 To retain compatibility with older client software, the default authentication plugin can be set to the legacy value (mysql_native_password)
 This should only be done if required third-party software has not been updated to work with the new authentication method.
 The change will be written to the file /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/default-auth-override.cnf
 .
 After installation, the default can be changed by setting the default_authentication_plugin server setting.
