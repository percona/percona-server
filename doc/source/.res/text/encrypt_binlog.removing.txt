Starting from release :rn:`8.0.15-5`, |Percona Server| uses the upstream
implementation of binary log encryption. The variable |encrypt-binlog| is
removed and the related command line option |opt.encrypt-binlog| is not
supported. It is important that you remove the |encrypt-binlog| variable from
your configuration file before you attempt to upgrade either from another
release in the |Percona Server| |version| series or from |Percona Server|
5.7. Otherwise, a server boot error will be produced reporting an unknown
variable. The implemented binary log encryption is compatible with the old
format: the binary log encrypted in a previous version of MySQL 8.0 series or
Percona Server for MySQL are supported.
