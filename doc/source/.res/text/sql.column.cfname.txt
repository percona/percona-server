The |sql.comment| clause can result in implicitly created column families. Although
the following example does not specify a column family using the
|cfname| attribute, column families ``my primary key`` and ``key ab`` are
created nevertheless.

.. code-block:: mysql

   CREATE TABLE t1( a INT, b INT, c INT, d INT,
   PRIMARY KEY(a) COMMENT 'my primary key',
   KEY ab(a,b) COMMENT 'key ab')
   ENGINE=ROCKSDB;

The option |opt.no-create-column-family| set to `false` will not allow column
families to be created using this implicit syntax of the ``COMMENT`` clause. In
order to be successfully created, the column family must already exist.

Alternatively, you can add a column family that you plan to use via the implicit
``COMMENT`` clause to the |opt.override-cf-options| option.

By default |opt.nccf| is set to `true`, which allows implicit column families.
