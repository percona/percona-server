If you are running a supported version of :ref:`Debian or Ubuntu <apt_repo>` or
:ref:`Red Hat Enterprise or CentOS <yum_repo>` with `systemd
<http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`_, you can run
:program:`systemctl` instead of :program:`service`. Currently, |Percona Server|
supports both :program:`systemctl` and :program:`service` system and service
managers.
