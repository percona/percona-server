Release Highlights
=================================================

Improvements and bug fixes provided by Oracle for *MySQL* 5.7.38 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* If a statement cannot be parsed, for example, if the statement contains syntax errors, that statement is not written to the slow query log.
* Loading an encrypted table failed if purge threads processed the undo records for that table.
* There was a memory leak when mysqldump was used on more than one table with the `--order-by-primary` option. The memory allocated to sort each row in a table is now released after every table.
