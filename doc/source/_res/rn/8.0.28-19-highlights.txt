Release Highlights
=================================================

Improvements and bug fixes introduced by Oracle for *MySQL* 8.0.28 and included in Percona Server for MySQL are the following:

* The ``ASCII`` shortcut for ``CHARACTER SET latin1`` and ``UNICODE`` shortcut for ``CHARACTER SET ucs2`` are deprecated and raise a warning to use ``CHARACTER SET`` instead. The shortcuts will be removed in a future version.
* A stored function and a loadable function with the same name can share the same namespace. Add the schema name when invoking a stored function in the shared namespace. The server generates a warning when function names collide.
* InnoDB supports ``ALTER TABLE ... RENAME COLUMN`` operations when using ``ALGORITHM=INSTANT``. 
* The limit for ``innodb_open_files`` now includes temporary tablespace files. The temporary tablespace files were not counted in the ``innodb_open_files`` in previous versions.
