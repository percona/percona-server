.. libcoredumper:

==================================
Using libcoredumper
==================================

:Availability: This feature is **Experimental** quality.

This feature was implemented in |Percona Server| 5.7.31-34 and has been tested against the supported operating systems for this version. The tool is experimental and may not be tested against newer operating systems in the future.

The documented moment of a computer when either the computer or an application crashed is a core dump file. Developers examine the dump as one of the tasks when searching for the cause of a failure. 

The ``libcoredumper`` is a free and Open Source fork of ``google-coredumper``, enhanced to work on newer Linux versions, and GCC and CLANG. 

You should test before putting this tool into production. 

.. rubric:: Enabling the ``libcoredumper``

Enable core dumps for troubleshooting purposes. 

To enable the ``libcoredumper``, add the ``coredumper`` variable to the ``mysqld`` section of ``my.cnf``. This variable is independent of the older ``core-file`` variable. 

The variable can have the following possible values: 

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{5cm}|p{11cm}|

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1

   * - Value 
     - Description
   * - Blank
     - The core dump is saved under MySQL datadir and named ``core``.
   * - A path ending with /
     - The core dump is saved under the specified directory and named ``core``.
   * - Full path with a filename
     - The core dump is saved under the specified directory and with the specified filename

Restart the server.

.. rubric:: Verifying the ``libcoredumper`` is Active

MySQL writes to the log when generating a core file and delegates the core dump operation to the Linux kernel. An example of the log message is the following:

.. code-block:: text

    Writing a core file

MySQL using the ``libcoredumper`` to generate the file creates the following message in the log:

.. code-block:: text

    Writing a core file using lib coredumper

Every core file adds a crash timestamp instead of a PID for the following reasons:

* Lets you correlate the core file with a crash. MySQL prints a UTC timestamp on the crash log.

    .. code-block:: bash

        10:02:09 UTC - mysqld got signal 11;


* Lets you keep multiple core files. 

.. note:: 

    For example, operators and containers run as PID 1. If the process ID identified the core file, each container crash generates a core dump that overwrites the previous core file.

.. rubric:: Disabling the libcoredumper

You can disable the libcoredumper. A core file may contain sensitive data and takes disk space. 

To disable the ``libcoredumper`` you must do the following:

1. In the ``mysqld`` section of my.cnf, remove the ``libcoredumper`` variable.
2. Restart the server.
