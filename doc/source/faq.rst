Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

Q: Will |Percona Server| with XtraDB invalidate our MySQL support?
======================================================================

A: We don't know the details of your support contract. You should check with your *Oracle* representative. We have heard anecdotal stories from MySQL Support team members that they have customers who use |Percona Server| with XtraDB, but you should not base your decision on that.

Q: Will we have to *GPL* our whole application if we use |Percona Server| with XtraDB?
========================================================================================

A: This is a common misconception about the *GPL*. We suggest reading the *Free Software Foundation* 's excellent reference material on the `GPL Version 2 <http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html>`_, which is the license that applies to MySQL and therefore to |Percona Server| with XtraDB. That document contains links to many other documents which should answer your questions. Percona is unable to give legal advice about the *GPL*.

Q: Do I need to install Percona client libraries?
===================================================

A: No, you don't need to change anything on the clients. |Percona Server| is 100% compatible with all existing client libraries and connectors.

Q: When using the |Percona XtraBackup| to setup a replication replica on Debian based systems I'm getting: "ERROR 1045 (28000): Access denied for user 'debian-sys-maint'@'localhost' (using password: YES)"
===============================================================================================================================================================================================================

A: In case you're using init script on Debian based system to start ``mysqld``, be sure that the password for ``debian-sys-maint`` user has been updated and it's the same as that user's password from the server that the backup has been taken from. Password can be seen and updated in :file:`/etc/mysql/debian.cnf`. For more information on how to set up a replication replica using |Percona XtraBackup| see `this how-to <http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtrabackup/2.1/howtos/setting_up_replication.html>`_.
