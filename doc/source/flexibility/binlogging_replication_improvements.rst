Binlogging and replication improvements
=======================================

Due to continuous development, *Percona Server for MySQL* incorporated a number of
improvements related to replication and binary logs handling. This resulted in
replication specifics, which distinguishes it from MySQL.

Temporary tables and mixed logging format
=========================================

Summary of the fix:
--------------------

As soon as some statement involving a temporary table was met when using the
MIXED binlog format, MySQL was switching to the row-based logging of all
statements till the end of the session or until all temporary tables used in
this session were dropped. It is inconvenient in the case of long lasting
connections, including replication-related ones. *Percona Server for MySQL* fixes the
situation by switching between statement-based and row-based logging as
necessary.

Version Specific Information
-----------------------------

  * :ref:`5.7.10-1`: Fix ported from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6

Details:
--------

The *mixed* binary logging format supported by *Percona Server for MySQL* means that
server runs in statement-based logging by default, but switches to row-based
logging when replication would be unpredictable - in the case of a
nondeterministic SQL statement that may cause data divergence if reproduced on
a replica server. The switch is done upon any condition from the long list, and
one of these conditions is the use of temporary tables.

Temporary tables are **never** logged using row-based format, but any
statement, that touches a temporary table, is logged in row mode. This way all
the side effects that temporary tables may produce on non-temporary ones are
intercepted.

There is no need to use row logging format for any other statements solely
because of the temp table presence. However MySQL was undertaking such an
excessive precaution: once some statement with temporary table had appeared and
the row-based logging was used, MySQL logged unconditionally all
subsequent statements in row format.

Percona Server have implemented more accurate behavior: instead of switching to
row-based logging until the last temporary table is closed, the usual rules of
row vs statement format apply, and presence of currently opened temporary
tables is no longer considered. This change was introduced with the fix of a
bug :psbug:`151` (upstream :mysqlbug:`72475`).

Temporary table drops and binloging on GTID-enabled server
==========================================================

Summary of the fix:
--------------------

MySQL logs DROP statements for all temporary tables irrelative of the logging
mode under which these tables were created. This produces binlog writes and
errand GTIDs on replicas with row and mixed logging. *Percona Server for MySQL* fixes this
by tracking the binlog format at temporary table create time and using it to
decide whether a DROP should be logged or not.

Version Specific Information
-----------------------------

  * :ref:`5.7.17-11`: Fix ported from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6

Details:
----------

Even with ``read_only`` mode enabled, the server permits some operations, including
ones with temporary tables. With the previous fix, temporary table operations
are not binlogged in row or mixed mode. But MySQL doesnâ€™t track what was
the logging mode when temporary table was created, and therefore
unconditionally logs ``DROP`` statements for all temporary tables. These
``DROP`` statements receive ``IF EXISTS`` addition, which is intended to make
them harmless.

*Percona Server for MySQL* have fixed this with the bug fixes :psbug:`964`, upstream
:mysqlbug:`83003`, and upstream :mysqlbug:`85258`. Moreover, after all the
binlogging fixes discussed so far nothing involving temporary tables is logged
to binary log in row or mixed format, and so there is no need to consider
``CREATE/DROP TEMPORARY TABLE`` unsafe for use in stored functions, triggers,
and multi-statement transactions in row/mixed format. Therefore an additional
fix was introduced to mark creation and drop of temporary tables as unsafe
inside transactions in statement-based replication only (bug fixed
:psbug:`1816`, upstream :mysqlbug:`89467`)).

Safety of statements with a ``LIMIT`` clause
============================================

Summary of the fix:
--------------------

MySQL considers all ``UPDATE/DELETE/INSERT ... SELECT`` statements with
``LIMIT`` clause to be unsafe, no matter wether they are really producing
non-deterministic result or not, and switches from statement-based logging
to row-based one. *Percona Server for MySQL* is more accurate, it acknowledges such
instructions as safe when they include ``ORDER BY PK`` or ``WHERE``
condition. This fix has been ported from the upstream bug report
:mysqlbug:`42415` (:psbug:`44`).

Version Specific Information
-----------------------------

  * :ref:`5.7.10.1`: Fix ported from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.6

Performance improvement on relay log position update
====================================================

Summary of the fix:
-------------------

MySQL always updated relay log position in multi-source replications setups
regardless of whether the committed transaction has already been executed or
not. Percona Server omitts relay log position updates for the already logged
GTIDs.

Version Specific Information
-----------------------------

  * :ref:`5.7.18-14`: Fix implemented in *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7

Details
--------

Particularly, such unconditional relay log position updates caused additional
fsync operations in case of ``relay-log-info-repository=TABLE``, and with the
higher number of channels transmitting such duplicate (already executed)
transactions the situation became proportionally worse. Bug fixed :psbug:`1786`
(upstream :mysqlbug:`85141`).

Performance improvement on source and connection status updates
===============================================================

Summary of the fix:
--------------------

Replica nodes configured to update source status and connection information
only on log file rotation did not experience the expected reduction in load.
MySQL was additionaly updating this information in case of multi-source
replication when replica had to skip the already executed GTID event.

Version Specific Information
-----------------------------

  * :ref:`5.7.20-19`: Fix implemented in *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7

Details
--------

The configuration with ``master_info_repository=TABLE`` and
``sync_master_info=0`` makes replica to update source status and connection
information in this table on log file rotation and not after each
sync_master_info event, but it didn't work on multi-source replication setups.
Heartbeats sent to the replica to skip GTID events which it had already executed
previously, were evaluated as relay log rotation events and reacted with
``mysql.slave_master_info`` table sync. This inaccuracy could produce huge (up
to 5 times on some setups) increase in write load on the replica, before this
problem was fixed in *Percona Server for MySQL*. Bug fixed :psbug:`1812` (upstream
:mysqlbug:`85158`).

.. _percona-server.binary-log.flush.writing:

Writing ``FLUSH`` Commands to the Binary Log
================================================================================

``FLUSH`` commands, such as ``FLUSH SLOW LOGS``, are not written to the
binary log if the system variable :ref:`binlog_skip_flush_commands` is set
to **ON**.

In addition, the following changes were implemented in the behavior of
``read_only`` and :ref:`super_read_only` modes:

- When ``read_only`` is set to **ON**, any ``FLUSH ...`` command executed by a
  normal user (without the ``SUPER`` privilege) are not written to the binary
  log regardless of the value of the :ref:`binlog_skip_flush_commands` variable.
- When :ref:`super_read_only` is set to **ON**, any ``FLUSH ...`` command executed by
  any user (even by those with the ``SUPER`` privilege) are not written to the
  binary log regardless of the value of the :ref:`binlog_skip_flush_commands` variable.

An attempt to run a ``FLUSH`` command without either ``SUPER`` or ``RELOAD``
privileges results in the ``ER_SPECIFIC_ACCESS_DENIED_ERROR`` exception
regardless of the value of the :ref:`binlog_skip_flush_commands` variable.

When binlog_skip_flush_command is set to **ON**, ``FLUSH ...`` commands are not written to the binary
log. See :ref:`percona-server.binary-log.flush.writing` for more information
about what else affects the writing of ``FLUSH`` commands to the binary log.

.. note::

   ``FLUSH LOGS``, ``FLUSH BINARY LOGS``, ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``, and
   ``FLUSH TABLES ... FOR EXPORT`` are not written to the binary log no matter
   what value the :ref:`binlog_skip_flush_commands` variable contains. The ``FLUSH`` command is not
   recorded to the binary log and the value of :ref:`binlog_skip_flush_commands` is ignored if the
   ``FLUSH`` command is run with the ``NO_WRITE_TO_BINLOG`` keyword (or its
   alias ``LOCAL``).

Limitations
====================

Do not use one or more dot characters (.) when defining the values for the following variables:

* `log_bin <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin>`__

* `log_bin_index <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/replication-options-binary-log.html#option_mysqld_log-bin-index>`__

MySQL and **XtraBackup** handle the value in different ways and this difference causes unpredictable behavior.
