.. _extended_mysqldump:

======================
Extended ``mysqldump``
======================

.. _mysqldump_backup_locks:

Backup Locks support
====================

In *Percona Server for MySQL* :ref:`5.7.10-1` ``mysqldump`` has been extended with a
new option, :option:`lock-for-backup` (disabled by default). When used together
with the :option:`--single-transaction` option, the option makes ``mysqldump``
issue ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` before starting the dump operation to prevent
unsafe statements that would normally result in an inconsistent backup.

More information can be found on the :ref:`backup_locks` feature documentation.

.. _mysqldump_compressed_columns:

Compressed Columns support
==========================

In *Percona Server for MySQL* :ref:`5.7.17-11` :command:`mysqldump` has been extended to
support :ref:`compressed_columns` feature. More information about the new
options can be found on the :ref:`compressed_columns` feature page.

.. _mysqldump_order_by_primary_desc:

Taking backup by descending primary key order
=============================================

In :ref:`5.7.17-12` new :option:`--order-by-primary-desc` has been
implemented. This feature tells ``mysqldump`` to take the backup by
descending primary key order (``PRIMARY KEY DESC``) which can be useful if
storage engine is using reverse order column for a primary key.

RocksDB support
===============

:command:`mysqldump` will now detect when MyRocks is installed and available
by seeing if there is a session variable named
:ref:`rocksdb_skip_fill_cache` and setting it to ``1`` if it exists.

:command:`mysqldump` will now automatically enable session variable
:ref:`rocksdb_bulk_load` if it is supported by target server.
