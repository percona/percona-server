 Installing |Percona Server| on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and CentOS
====================================================================

.. package name: percona-server-server-8.0.13-3.1.el7.x86_64.rpm

Ready-to-use packages are available from the |Percona Server| software
repositories and the `download page
<http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-8.0/>`_. The
|Percona| :program:`yum` repository supports popular *RPM*-based
operating systems, including the *Amazon Linux AMI*.

The easiest way to install the *Percona Yum* repository is to install an *RPM*
that configures :program:`yum` and installs the `Percona GPG key
<https://www.percona.com/downloads/RPM-GPG-KEY-percona>`_.

Specific information on the supported platforms, products, and versions are described in `Percona Software and Platform Lifecycle <https://www.percona.com/services/policies/percona-software-platform-lifecycle#mysql>`_.

|Percona Server| is certified for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. This certification is based on common and secure best practices, and successful interoperability with the operating system. Percona Server is listed in the `Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog <https://catalog.redhat.com/software/applications/detail/5869161>`_.

Installing |Percona Server| from Percona ``yum`` repository
===========================================================

You can install Percona yum repository by running the following commands as a ``root`` user or with sudo.

1. Install the Percona repository

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo yum install https://repo.percona.com/yum/percona-release-latest.noarch.rpm

   You should see an output that the files are being downloaded, like the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      percona-release-latest.noarch-rpm               36 kB/s | 19 kb 00:00
      =====================================================================

      Installing:
         percona release    noarch         1.0-25     @commandline  19k
      ...

#. Enable the repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo percona-release setup ps80
      On RedHat 8 systems it is needed to disable dnf mysql module to install Percona-Server
      Do you want to disable it? [y/N] y
      ...

#. Install the packages

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo yum install percona-server-server

.. note::

   |Percona Server| 8.0 also provides the :ref:`TokuDB storage engine
   <tokudb_intro>` and :ref:`MyRocks <myrocks_intro>` storage engines which can
   be installed as plugins. For more information on how
   to install and enable the |TokuDB| storage review the :ref:`tokudb_installation`
   document. For information on how to install and enable |MyRocks| review the
   section :ref:`myrocks_install`.

Percona `yum` Testing repository
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Percona offers pre-release builds from our testing repository. To
subscribe to the testing repository, you'll need to enable the testing
repository in :file:`/etc/yum.repos.d/percona-release.repo`. To do so,
set both ``percona-testing-$basearch`` and ``percona-testing-noarch``
to ``enabled = 1`` (Note that there are three sections in this file:
release, testing and experimental - in this case it is the second
section that requires updating). **NOTE:** You'll need to install the
Percona repository first (ref above) if this hasn't been done already.

Installing |Percona Server| using downloaded rpm packages
================================================================================

1. Download the packages of the desired series for your architecture from the
   `download page <http://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-8.0/>`_. The
   easiest way is to download bundle which contains all the packages. Following
   example will download |Percona Server| 8.0.21-12 release packages for *CentOS*
   8:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ wget https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-8.0/Percona-Server-8.0.21-12/binary/redhat/8/x86_64/Percona-Server-8.0.21-12-r7ddfdfe-el8-x86_64-bundle.tar

2. Unpack the bundle to get the packages: :bash:`tar xvf Percona-Server-8.0.21-12-r7ddfdfe-el8-x86_64-bundle.tar`

3. To view a list of packages, run the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ ls *.rpm

      percona-mysql-router-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-mysql-router-debuginfo-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-client-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-client-debuginfo-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-debuginfo-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-debugsource-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-devel-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-rocksdb-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-rocksdb-debuginfo-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-server-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-server-debuginfo-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona- server-shared-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-shared-compat-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-shared-debuginfo-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-test-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-test-debuginfo-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm
      percona-server-tokudb-8.0.21-12.2.el8.x86_64.rpm

4. Install ``jemalloc`` with the following command, if needed:

  .. code-block:: bash

     wget https://repo.percona.com/yum/release/8/RPMS/x86_64/jemalloc-3.6.0-1.el8.x86_64.rpm

5.  For a RHEL/CentOS 8 package installation, |Percona Server| requires the mysql module to be disabled before installing the packages: 

    .. code-block:: bash

        sudo yum module disable mysql 

6. Install all the packages (for debugging, testing, etc.) with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo rpm -ivh *.rpm

.. note::

   When installing packages manually, you must make sure to
   resolve all dependencies and install any missing packages yourself.

Running |Percona Server|
========================

|Percona Server| stores the data files in :file:`/var/lib/mysql/` by
default. The configuration file used to manage |Percona
Server| is the :file:`/etc/my.cnf`.

The following commands start, provide the server status, stop the server, and restart the server:

* |Percona Server| is not started automatically on *RHEL* and *CentOS* after installation. Start the server with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo service mysql start

* Review the service status with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo service mysql status

* Stop the service with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo service mysql stop

* Restart the service with the following command:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo service mysql restart

.. note::

   *RHEL* 7 and *CentOS* 7 come with `systemd
   <http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/>`_ as the default
   system and service manager so you can invoke all the above commands
   with ``sytemctl`` instead of ``service``. Currently, both are
   supported.

Working with SELinux
======================

For information on working with SELinux, see :ref:`selinux`.

Uninstalling |Percona Server|
=============================

To completely uninstall |Percona Server|, remove all the installed packages and data files.

1.  Stop the |Percona Server| service:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ sudo service mysql stop
        
#. Remove the packages:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ sudo yum remove percona-server*

#. Remove the data and configuration files:

.. warning::

    This step removes all the packages and deletes all the data files (databases,
    tables, logs, etc.). Take a backup before doing this in case you need the data.


   .. code-block:: bash

      $ rm -rf /var/lib/mysql
      $ rm -f /etc/my.cnf
