Backup Locks
================================================================================

|Percona Server| offers the ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` statement as a
lightweight alternative to ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` for both physical and
logical backups.

LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP
================================================================================

``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` uses a new MDL lock type to block updates to
non-transactional tables and DDL statements for all tables. If there is an
active ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` lock then all DDL statements and all updates
to MyISAM, CSV, MEMORY, ARCHIVE, |TokuDB|, and |MyRocks| tables will be blocked
in the ``Waiting for backup lock`` status, visible in ``PERFORMANCE_SCHEMA`` or
``PROCESSLIST``.

``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` has no effect on ``SELECT`` queries for all mentioned
storage engines. Against |InnoDB|, |MyRocks|, Blackhole and Federated tables,
the ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` is not applicable to the ``INSERT``, ``REPLACE``,
``UPDATE``, ``DELETE`` statements: Blackhole tables obviously have no relevance
to backups, and Federated tables are ignored by both logical and physical backup
tools.

Unlike ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK``, ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` does not
flush tables, i.e. storage engines are not forced to close tables and tables are
not expelled from the table cache. As a result, ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` only
waits for conflicting statements to complete (i.e. DDL and updates to
non-transactional tables). It never waits for SELECTs, or UPDATEs to |InnoDB| or
|MyRocks| tables to complete, for example.

If an "unsafe" statement is executed in the same connection that is holding a
``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` lock, it fails with the following error: ::

 ERROR 1880 (HY000): Can't execute the query because you have a conflicting backup lock

 UNLOCK TABLES releases the lock acquired by LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP.

The intended use case for |Percona XtraBackup| is: :: 

  LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP
  ... copy .frm, MyISAM, CSV, etc. ...
  UNLOCK TABLES
  ... get binlog coordinates ...
  ... wait for redo log copying to finish ...

Privileges
================================================================================

The ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` requires the ``BACKUP_ADMIN``
privilege. 

Interaction with other global locks
================================================================================

The ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` has no effect if the current connection already
owns a ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` lock, as it is a more restrictive
lock. If ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` is executed in a connection that has
acquired ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP``, ``FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK`` fails with
an error.

If the server is operating in the read-only mode (i.e. :variable:`read_only` set
to ``1``), statements that are unsafe for backups will be either blocked or fail
with an error, depending on whether they are executed in the same connection
that owns ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` lock, or other connections.

MyISAM index and data buffering
================================================================================

|MyISAM| key buffering is normally write-through, i.e. by the time each update
to a |MyISAM| table is completed, all index updates are written to disk. The
only exception is delayed key writing feature which is disabled by default.

When the global system variable :variable:`delay_key_write` is set to ``ALL``,
key buffers for all |MyISAM| tables are not flushed between updates, so a
physical backup of those tables may result in broken |MyISAM| indexes. To
prevent this, ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` will fail with an error if
``delay_key_write`` is set to ``ALL``. An attempt to set
:variable:`delay_key_write` to ``ALL`` when there's an active backup lock will
also fail with an error.

Another option to involve delayed key writing is to create |MyISAM| tables with
the DELAY_KEY_WRITE option and set the :variable:`delay_key_write` variable to
``ON`` (which is the default). In this case, ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` will not
be able to prevent stale index files from appearing in the backup. Users are
encouraged to set :variable:`delay_key_writes` to ``OFF`` in the configuration
file, :file:`my.cnf`, or repair |MyISAM| indexes after restoring from a physical
backup created with backup locks.

|MyISAM| may also cache data for bulk inserts, e.g. when executing multi-row
INSERTs or ``LOAD DATA`` statements. Those caches, however, are flushed between
statements, so have no effect on physical backups as long as all statements
updating |MyISAM| tables are blocked.

The mysqldump Command
================================================================================

``mysqldump`` has also been extended with a new option,
:option:`lock-for-backup` (disabled by default). When used together with the
:option:`--single-transaction` option, the option makes ``mysqldump`` issue
``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` before starting the dump operation to prevent unsafe
statements that would normally result in an inconsistent backup.

When used without the :option:`single-transaction` option,
:option:`lock-for-backup` is automatically converted to
:option:`lock-all-tables`.

The option :option:`lock-for-backup` is mutually exclusive with
:option:`lock-all-tables`, i.e. specifying both on the command line will lead to
an error.

If the backup locks feature is not supported by the target server, but
:option:`lock-for-backup` is specified on the command line, ``mysqldump`` aborts
with an error.

Version Specific Information
================================================================================

  * :rn:`8.0.12-1`
        Feature ported from |Percona Server| 5.7.

System Variables
================================================================================

.. variable:: have_backup_locks

     :cli: Yes
     :conf: No
     :scope: Global
     :dyn: No
     :vartype: Boolean
     :default: YES

This is a server variable implemented to help other utilities decide what
locking strategy can be implemented for a server. When available, the backup
locks feature is supported by the server and the variable value is always
``YES``.

Status Variables
================================================================================

.. variable:: Com_lock_tables_for_backup

     :vartype: Numeric
     :scope: Global/Session

This status variable indicates the number of times the corresponding statements
have been executed.

Client Command Line Parameter
================================================================================

.. option:: lock-for-backup

     :cli: Yes
     :scope: Global
     :dyn: No
     :vartype: String
     :default: Off

When used together with the :option:`--single-transaction` option, the option
makes ``mysqldump`` issue ``LOCK TABLES FOR BACKUP`` before starting the dump
operation to prevent unsafe statements that would normally result in an
inconsistent backup.
