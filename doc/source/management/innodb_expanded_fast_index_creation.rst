================================================================================

:Availability: This feature is **Experimental** qualtiy.

Percona has implemented several changes related to |MySQL|'s fast index creation
feature. Fast index creation was implemented in |MySQL| as a way to speed up the
process of adding or dropping indexes on tables with many rows.

This feature implements a session variable that enables extended fast index
creation. Besides optimizing DDL directly,
:variable:`expand_fast_index_creation` may also optimize index access for
subsequent DML statements because using it results in much less fragmented
indexes.

The |mysqldump| Command
================================================================================

A new option, ``--innodb-optimize-keys``, was implemented in |mysqldump|. It
changes the way |InnoDB| tables are dumped, so that secondary and foreign keys
are created after loading the data, thus taking advantage of fast index
creation. More specifically:

* ``KEY``, ``UNIQUE KEY``, and ``CONSTRAINT`` clauses are omitted from ``CREATE
  TABLE`` statements corresponding to |InnoDB| tables.
* An additional ``ALTER TABLE`` is issued after dumping the data, in order to
  create the previously omitted keys.

``ALTER TABLE``
================================================================================

When ``ALTER TABLE`` requires a table copy, secondary keys are now dropped and
recreated later, after copying the data. The following restrictions apply:

* Only non-unique keys can be involved in this optimization.
* If the table contains foreign keys, or a foreign key is being added as a part
  of the current ``ALTER TABLE`` statement, the optimization is disabled for all
  keys.

``OPTIMIZE TABLE``
================================================================================

Internally, ``OPTIMIZE TABLE`` is mapped to ``ALTER TABLE ... ENGINE=innodb``
for |InnoDB| tables. As a consequence, it now also benefits from fast index
creation, with the same restrictions as for ``ALTER TABLE``.


Caveats
================================================================================

|InnoDB| fast index creation uses temporary files in tmpdir for all indexes
being created. So make sure you have enough tmpdir space when using
:variable:`expand_fast_index_creation`. It is a session variable, so you can
temporarily switch it off if you are short on tmpdir space and/or don’t want
this optimization to be used for a specific table.

There’s also a number of cases when this optimization is not applicable:

* ``UNIQUE`` indexes in ``ALTER TABLE`` are ignored to enforce uniqueness where
  necessary when copying the data to a temporary table;
* ``ALTER TABLE`` and ``OPTIMIZE TABLE`` always process tables containing
  foreign keys as if :variable:`expand_fast_index_creation` is OFF to avoid
  dropping keys that are part of a FOREIGN KEY constraint;
* :command:`mysqldump --innodb-optimize-keys` ignores foreign keys because
  |InnoDB| requires a full table rebuild on foreign key changes. So adding them
  back with a separate ``ALTER TABLE`` after restoring the data from a dump
  would actually make the restore slower;
* :command:`mysqldump --innodb-optimize-keys` ignores indexes on
  ``AUTO_INCREMENT`` columns, because they must be indexed, so it is impossible
  to temporarily drop the corresponding index;
* :command:`mysqldump --innodb-optimize-keys` ignores the first UNIQUE index on
  non-nullable columns when the table has no ``PRIMARY KEY`` defined, because in
  this case |InnoDB| picks such an index as the clustered one.
