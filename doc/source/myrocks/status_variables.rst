MyRocks Status Variables
========================

MyRocks status variables provide details
about the inner workings of the storage engine
and they can be useful in tuning the storage engine
to a particular environment.

You can view these variables and their values by running:

.. code-block:: mysql

  mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'rocksdb%';

The following global status variables are available:

.. tabularcolumns:: |p{9cm}|p{6cm}|

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
