.. _aio_page_requests:

=======================================
Multiple page asynchronous I/O requests
=======================================

The I/O unit size in |InnoDB| is only one page, even if the server doing read ahead. 
A 16KB I/O unit size is small for sequential reads, and less efficient than a
larger I/O unit size. |InnoDB| uses Linux asynchronous I/O (``aio``) by default. 
By submitting multiple
consecutive 16KB read requests at once, Linux internally can merge requests and
reads can be done more efficiently. This feature can submit multiple 
page I/O requests and works in the background. 

You can manage the feature with the 
`linear read-ahead <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-performance-read_ahead.html>`_ technique. 
The technique adds pages to the buffer pool based on the buffer pool pages being accessed
sequentially. The configuration parameter, ``innodb_read_ahead_threshold`` controls this process.

`On a HDD RAID 1+0 environment
<http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.hr/2013/10/making-full-table-scan-10x-faster-in.html>`_,
more than 1000MB/s disk reads can be achieved by submitting 64 consecutive pages
requests at once, while only
160MB/s disk reads is shown by submitting single page request.

Version Specific Information
============================

 * :rn:`5.6.38-83.0`- Feature ported from the *Facebook MySQL* patch.

Status Variables
================

.. variable:: Innodb_buffered_aio_submitted

  :version 5.6.38-83.0: Implemented
  :vartype: Numeric
  :scope: Global

This variable shows the total number of submitted buffered asynchronous I/O requests.
The variable is updated after the submission request to the kernel and is a
counter, which always increases.

The following is an example of a variable call:

.. code-block:: mysql

   mysql> SHOW GLOBAL STATUS like "innodb_buffered_aio_submitted";

   innodb_buffered_aio_submitted 12439
