Bugs Fixed
==========

 ``RPM`` pre-install script assumed that the ``PID`` file was always located in the :variable:`datadir`. As a result, during installation, wrong assumption could be made if the server was running or not. Bug fixed :bug:`1201896`.
 
 ``SHOW GRANTS`` displayed only the privileges granted explicitly to the named account. Other privileges which might be available to the account, (if an anonymous account exists, the named account might be able to use its privileges) were not displayed. Bug fixed :bug:`1354988` (upstream :mysqlbug:`53645`).
 
 |InnoDB| lock monitor output was printed even if it was not requested. Bug fixed :bug:`1418996`.

 The stored procedure key (``# Stored procedure:``) was using spaces instead of underscores in the :ref:`slow_extended_55`. Bug fixed :bug:`1419230`.
 
Other bugs fixed: :bug:`1408232`, :bug:`1415843` (upstream :mysqlbug:`75642`), bug fixed :bug:`1407941`, and bug fixed :bug:`1424568` (upstream :bug:`75868`).
