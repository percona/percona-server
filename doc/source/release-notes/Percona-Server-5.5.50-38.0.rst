New Features
============

 |Percona Server| has implemented protocol support for :ref:`TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 <extended_tls_support>`. This implementation automatically disables TLS v1.0 support.

Bugs Fixed
==========

 Querying the :table:`GLOBAL_TEMPORARY_TABLES` table would cause server crash if temporary table owning threads would execute new queries. Bug fixed :bug:`1581949`.

 The :variable:`innodb_log_block_size` feature attempted to diagnose the situation where the logs have been created with a log block value that differs from the current :variable:`innodb_log_block_size` setting. But this diagnostics came too late, and a misleading error ``No valid checkpoints found`` was produced first, aborting the startup. Bug fixed :bug:`1155156`.

 ``AddressSanitizer`` build with ``LeakSanitizer`` enabled was failing at ``gen_lex_hash`` invocation. Bug fixed :bug:`1580993` (upstream :mysqlbug:`80014`).

 :file:`ssl.cmake` file was broken when custom OpenSSL build was used. Bug fixed :bug:`1582639` (upstream :mysqlbug:`61619`).

 ``mysqlbinlog`` did not free the existing connection before opening a new remote one. Bug fixed :bug:`1587840` (upstream :mysqlbug:`81675`).

 Fixed memory leaks in ``mysqltest``. Bugs fixed :bug:`1582718` and :bug:`1588318`.

 Fixed memory leaks in ``mysqlcheck``. Bug fixed :bug:`1582741`.

 Fixed memory leak in ``mysqlbinlog``. Bug fixed :bug:`1582761` (upstream :mysqlbug:`78223`).

 Fixed memory leaks in ``mysqldump``. Bug fixed :bug:`1587873` and :bug:`1588845` (upstream :mysqlbug:`81714`).
