and from the :doc:`Percona Software Repositories </installation>`).

Based on `MySQL 5.7.13
<http://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/5.7/en/news-5-7-14.html>`_, including
all the bug fixes in it, |Percona Server| 5.7.14-7 is the current GA release in
the |Percona Server| 5.7 series. All of Percona's software is open-source and
free, all the details of the release can be found in the `5.7.14-7 milestone at
Launchpad <https://launchpad.net/percona-server/+milestone/5.7.14-7>`_

New Features
============

 |Percona Server| :ref:`audit_log_plugin` now supports filtering by :ref:`user
 <filtering_by_user>`, :ref:`database <filtering_by_database>`, and
 :ref:`sql_command <filtering_by_sql_command_type>`.

 |Percona Server| now supports `tree map file block allocation strategy
 <https://www.percona.com/blog/2016/08/17/improve-tokudbperconaft-fragmented-data-file-performance/>`_
 for TokuDB.

Bugs Fixed
==========

 Fixed potential cardinality ``0`` issue for TokuDB tables if ``ANALYZE
 TABLE`` finds only deleted rows and no actual logical rows before it times
 out. Bug fixed :bug:`1607300` (:tokubug:`1006`, :ftbug:`732`).

 TokuDB ``database.table.index`` names longer than 256 characters could cause
 server crash if :ref:`background analyze table
 <tokudb_background_analyze_table>` status was checked while running. Bug fixed
 :tokubug:`1005`.

 :ref:`pam_plugin` would abort authentication while checking UNIX user group
 membership if there were more than a thousand members. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1608902`.

 If ``DROP DATABASE`` would fail to delete some of the tables in the database,
 the partially-executed command is logged in the binlog as ``DROP TABLE t1, t2,
 ...``  for the tables for which drop succeeded. A slave might fail to
 replicate such ``DROP TABLE`` statement if there exist foreign key
 relationships to any of the dropped tables and the slave has a different
 schema from master. Fix by checking, on the master, whether any of the
 database to be dropped tables participate in a Foreign Key relationship, and
 fail the ``DROP DATABASE`` statement immediately. Bug fixed :bug:`1525407`
 (upstream :mysqlbug:`79610`).

 :ref:`pam_plugin` didn't support spaces in the UNIX user group names. Bug
 fixed :bug:`1544443`.

 Due to security reasons ``ld_preload`` libraries can now only be loaded from
 the system directories (:file:`/usr/lib64`, :file:`/usr/lib`) and the *MySQL*
 installation base directory.

 In the client library, any EINTR received during network I/O was not handled
 correctly. Bug fixed :bug:`1591202` (upstream :mysqlbug:`82019`).

 ``SHOW GLOBAL STATUS`` was locking more than the upstream implementation which
 made it less suitable to be called with high frequency. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1592290`.

 The included :file:`.gitignore` in the percona-server source distribution had
 a line ``*.spec``, which means someone trying to check in a copy of the
 percona-server source would be missing the spec file required to build the
 RPMs. Bug fixed :bug:`1600051`.

 :ref:`audit_log_plugin` did not transcode queries. Bug fixed :bug:`1602986`.

 If the changed page bitmap redo log tracking thread stops due to any reason,
 then shutdown will wait for a long time for the log tracker thread to quit,
 which it never does. Bug fixed :bug:`1606821`.

 Changed page tracking was initialized too late by InnoDB. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1612574`.

 Fixed stack buffer overflow if :variable:`--ssl-cipher` had more than 4000
 characters. Bug fixed :bug:`1596845` (upstream :mysqlbug:`82026`).

 :ref:`audit_log_plugin` events did not report the default database. Bug fixed
 :bug:`1435099`.

 Canceling the :ref:`tokudb_background_analyze_table` job twice or while it was
 in the queue could lead to server assertion. Bug fixed :tokubug:`1004`.

 Fixed various spelling errors in comments and function names. Bug fixed
 :ftbug:`728` (*Otto Kekäläinen*)

 Implemented set of fixes to make PerconaFT build and run on the AArch64
 (64-bit ARMv8) architecture. Bug fixed :ftbug:`726` (*Alexey Kopytov*).

Other bugs fixed: :bug:`1542874` (upstream :mysqlbug:`80296`), :bug:`1610242`,
:bug:`1604462` (upstream :mysqlbug:`82283`), :bug:`1604774` (upstream
:mysqlbug:`82307`), :bug:`1606782`, :bug:`1607359`, :bug:`1607606`,
:bug:`1607606`, :bug:`1607671`, :bug:`1609422`, :bug:`1610858`, :bug:`1612551`,
:bug:`1613663`, :bug:`1613986`, :bug:`1455430`, :bug:`1455432`, :bug:`1581195`,
:tokubug:`998`, :tokubug:`1003`, and :ftbug:`730`.
