Bugs Fixed
==========

 *MyRocks* storage engine detection implemented in ``mysqldump`` in |Percona
 Server| :rn:`5.6.17-12` was using a deprecated
 :table:`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.SESSION_VARIABLES` table, causing ``mysqldump``
 failures on servers running with :variable:`show_compatibility_56` variable
 set to ``OFF``. Bug fixed :bug:`1676401`.
