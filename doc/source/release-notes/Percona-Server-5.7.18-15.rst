Bugs Fixed
==========

 Server would crash when querying partitioning table with a single partition.
 Bug fixed :bug:`1657941` (upstream :mysqlbug:`76418`).

 Running a query on InnoDB table with `ngram full-text parser
 <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/fulltext-search-ngram.html>`_ and a
 ``LIMIT`` clause could lead to a server crash. Bug fixed :bug:`1679025`
