Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

- Parallel doublewrite buffer writes must crash the server on an I/O error occurs. Bug fixed :psbug:`5678`.

- On a server with two million or more tables using foreign keys and AUTOINC columns, the shutdown may take a measurable length of time. Bug fixed :psbug:`5639`. (Upstream :mysqlbug:`95895`)

- If large pages are enabled on the MySQL side, the maximum size for :variable:`innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size` is effectively limited to 4GB. Bug fixed :psbug:`5517`. (Upstream :mysqlbug:`94747`)

- The TokuDB hot backup library continually dumps TRACE information to the Server error log. The user cannot enable or disable the dump of this information. Bug fixed :psbug:`4850`.

- The TokuDBBackupPlugin is optional at cmake time. Bug fixed :psbug:`5748`.

- A multi-table ``DELETE`` with a foreign key breaks replication. Bug fixed :psbug:`3845`.


- A ``TRUNCATE`` with any table and interfacing with Adaptive Hash Index (AHI) can cause server stalls due to the interaction with AHI, whether the AHI is enabled or not. Bug fixed :psbug:`5576`. (Upstream :mysqlbug:`94610`)


- In specific configurations and with :variable:`log_slow_verbosity` set to log InnoDB statistics, memory usage increases while running a stored procedure.  Bug fixed :psbug:`5581`.

- :ref:`threadpool` functionality to track network I/O was disabled.  Bug fixed :psbug:`5723`.

- When Adaptive Hash Index (AHI) is enabled or disabled, there is an AHI overhead during DDL operations. Bug fixed :psbug:`5747`.

- An instance started with the default values but setting the `redo-log` to encrypt without specifying the keyring plugin parameters does not fail or throw an error. Bug fixed :psbug:`5476`.

- Setting the encryption to ``ON`` for the system tablespace generates the encryption key and encrypts system temporary tablespace pages. Resetting encryption to ``OFF`` , all subsequent pages are written to the temporary tablespace without encryption. To allow any encrypted tables to be decrypted, the generated keys are not erased. Modifying the :variable:`innodb_temp_tablespace_encrypt` does not affect file-per-table temporary tables. This type of table is encrypted if ``ENCRYPTION`` ='Y' is set during the table creation. Bug fixed :psbug:`5736`.

- After resetting the :variable:`innodb_temp_tablespace_encrypt` to ``OFF`` during runtime, the subsequent file-per-table temporary tables continue to be encrypted. Bug fixed :psbug:`5734`.
