Bugs Fixed
===============================================================================

- When using `skip-innodb_doublewrite` in my.cnf, a parallel doublewrite buffer is still created. Bugs fixed :psbug:`3411`.

- During a binlogging replication event, if the master crashes after the multi-threaded slave has begun copying to the slave's relay log and before the process has completed, a `STOP SLAVE` on the slave takes longer than expected. Bug fixed :psbug:`5824`.

- If `pam_krb5 <https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E88353_01/html/E37853/pam-krb5-7.html>`__ is configured to allow the user to change their password, and the password expired, the server crashed after receiving the new password. Bug fixed :psbug:`6023`.
