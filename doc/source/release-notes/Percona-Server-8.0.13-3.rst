Features Removed in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0
================================================================================

- Slow Query Log Rotation and Expiration: Not widely used, can be accomplished
  using ``logrotate``
- CSV engine mode for standard-compliant quote and comma parsing
- Expanded program option modifiers
- The ``ALL_O_DIRECT`` InnoDB flush method: it is not compatible with the
  new redo logging implementation
- ``XTRADB_RSEG`` table from ``INFORMATION_SCHEMA``
- InnoDB memory size information from ``SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;`` the
  same information is available from Performance Schema memory summary
  tables
- Query cache enhancements: The query cache is no longer present in
  MySQL 8.0

Features Being Deprecated in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0
================================================================================

- |TokuDB| Storage Engine: |TokuDB| will be supported throughout the |Percona
  Server| 8.0 release series, but will not be available in the next major
  release. |Percona| encourages |TokuDB| users to explore the |MyRocks| Storage
  Engine which provides similar benefits for the majority of workloads and has
  better optimized support for modern hardware.
