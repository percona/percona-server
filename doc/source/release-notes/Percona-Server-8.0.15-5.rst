================================================================================

|Percona| announces the release of |Percona Server| |release| on |date|
(downloads are available `here
<https://www.percona.com/downloads/Percona-Server-8.0/>`__ and from the `Percona
Software Repositories
<https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/installation.html#installing-from-binaries>`__).

This release includes fixes to bugs found in previous releases of |Percona
Server| 8.0.

.. admonition:: Incompatible changes

   In previous releases, the audit log used to produce time stamps
   inconsistent with the ISO 8601 standard. Release |release| of
   |Percona Server| solves this problem. This change, however, may
   break programs that rely on the old time stamp format.

This release is based on |MySQL| 8.0.14 and 8.0.15. It includes all
bug fixes in these releases. |Percona Server| :rn:`8.0.14` was skipped.

|Percona Server| |release| is now the current GA release in the 8.0
series. All of |Percona|â€™s software is open-source and free.

Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 includes all the `features available in MySQL 8.0
Community Edition
<https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/mysql-nutshell.html>`__ in addition to
enterprise-grade features developed by Percona.  For a list of highlighted
