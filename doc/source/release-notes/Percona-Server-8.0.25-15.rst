the
`MySQL 8.0.25 Community Edition <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/news-8-0-25.html>`_

.. note::

    The TokuDB Storage Engine was `declared as deprecated <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/8.0/release-notes/Percona-Server-8.0.13-3.html>`__ in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0 and will be disabled in upcoming 8.0 versions. 
    
    We recommend migrating to the MyRocks Storage Engine.
