Release Highlights
=================================================

The following lists a number of the bug fixes for *MySQL* 8.0.27, provided by Oracle, and included in Percona Server for MySQL:

* The ``default_authentication_plugin`` is deprecated. Support for this plugin may be removed in future versions. Use the ``authentication_policy`` variable.
* The ``binary`` operator is deprecated. Support for this operator may be removed in future versions. Use ``CAST(... AS BINARY)``.
* Fix for when a parent table initiates a cascading ``SET NULL`` operation on the child table, the virtual column can be set to NULL instead of the value derived from the parent table.

New Features
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PS-7960`: Documented the ``rocksdb_partial_index_sort_max_mem`` variable, the ``rocksdb_bulk_load_partial_index`` variable, and the ``rocksdb_cancel_manual_compactions`` variable.
* :jirabug:`PS-2346`: LP #720547: Implemented an option to allow queries with specific error codes to add entries to the Slow Query Log.


Improvements
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PS-7955`: Enabled ZenFS functionality on standard Percona Server packages on Debian 11 and Ubuntu 20.04.
* :jirabug:`PS-7931`: Implemented a :ref:`slowlog_rotation` in Percona Server for MySQL 8.0.
* :jirabug:`PS-6730`: The 'Last_errno:' field in the Slow Query Log contains only error information.
* :jirabug:`PS-8076`: Added a deprecation warning when using :ref:`changed_page_tracking`. 

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================

* :jirabug:`PS-7883`: An ``ALTER`` query caused a server exit when ``--rocksdb_write_disable_wal`` was enabled.
* :jirabug:`PS-8007`: *Percona Server for MySQL* can fail to start if the server starts before the network mounts the datadir or a local mount of the datadir.
* :jirabug:`PS-7977`: The AppArmor profile is broken after an 8.0.22-13 to 8.0.23-14 upgrade. (Thanks to Alex Kompel for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`PS-7958`: A ``SELECT`` statement using a Full-Text Search index with a special character caused a server exit.
* :jirabug:`PS-7940`: The initialization of a virtual column template if a child table had a virtual column caused a restart loop. This initialization prevented a server exit when there was an ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` statement in the parent table and the child table had virtual columns. (Upstream :mysqlbug:`105290`)
* :jirabug:`PS-5654`: On a view, the query digest for each SELECT statement is now based on the SELECT statement and not the view definition, which was the case for earlier versions (Upstream :mysqlbug:`89559`)
* :jirabug:`PS-7975`: Fix to allow test main.mtr_unit_tests to complete successfully (Thanks to Thomas Deutschmann for reporting this issue)
* :jirabug:`PS-7873`: Fix for when the log_status table reported an incorrect executed_gtid (Thanks to zhujzhuo for reporting this issue) (Upstream :mysqlbug:`102175`)
* :jirabug:`PS-5168` Fix for when the Slow Query Log reports ``tmp_table_size:0``.
* Normalized the ``zenfs`` utility backup and restore requirements for the ``--path`` command line option, the ``--backup_path`` command-lne option, and the ``restore_path`` command-line option. For more information, see :ref:`zenfs`.

Packaging Notes
======================

* Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (and derivative Linux distributions) are no longer supported.

Known issues
