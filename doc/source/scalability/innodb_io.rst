===================================
 Improved |InnoDB| I/O Scalability
===================================

Because |InnoDB| is a complex storage engine it must be configured properly in order to perform at its best. Some points are not configurable in standard |InnoDB|. The goal of this feature is to provide a more exhaustive set of options for |XtraDB|, like ability to change the log block size. 

Version Specific Information
============================

  * :rn:`5.6.11-60.3`

    * Feature ported from |Percona Server| 5.5
   
  * :rn:`5.6.14-62.0` 
    
    * New :variable:`innodb_log_checksum_algorithm` variable introduced. 

System Variables
================


.. variable:: innodb_use_global_flush_log_at_trx_commit

   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :dyn: Yes
   :type: Boolean
   :default: True
   :range: True/False

This variable enables or disables the effect of the per-session value of 
the `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` variable. 

If the global variable  `innodb_use_global_flush_log_at_trx_commit` is
set to ``1``, the session will always use the current
global value of `innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`. This is the
upstream compatible mode. If the user attempts to change the
`innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit` value for a
session, the session value is ignored.

If the global variable `innodb_use_global_flush_log_at_trx_commit` is set to
``0``, a user can modify the
``innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit`` per-session using the following command:

.. code-block:: MySQL

    SET SESSION innodb_flush_log_at_trx_commit=0

This modification only affects the transactions in that session. Other sessions,
if they have not been individually modified, continue to use the
global `innodb_use_flush_log_at_trx_commit` value.

.. variable:: innodb_log_block_size

     :cli: Yes
     :conf: Yes
     :scope: Global
     :dyn: No
     :vartype: Numeric
     :default: 512
     :units: Bytes

This variable changes the size of transaction log records. The default size of 512 bytes is good in most situations. However, setting it to 4096 may be a good optimization with SSD cards. While settings other than 512 and 4096 are possible, as a practical matter these are really the only two that it makes sense to use. Clean restart and removal of the old logs is needed for the variable :variable:`innodb_log_block_size` to be changed. **Note:** This feature implementation is considered BETA quality.

.. variable:: innodb_flush_method

   :Version Info: - :rn:`5.6.13-61.0` - Ported from |Percona Server| 5.5
   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :Dyn: No
   :vartype: Enumeration
   :default: ``fdatasync``
   :allowed: ``fdatasync``, ``O_DSYNC``, ``O_DIRECT``, ``O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC``, ``ALL_O_DIRECT``

This is an existing |MySQL| 5.6 system variable that has a new allowed value ``ALL_O_DIRECT``. It determines the method |InnoDB| uses to flush its data and log files. (See ``innodb_flush_method`` in the |MySQL| 5.6 `Reference Manual <https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/innodb-parameters.html#sysvar_innodb_flush_method>`_).

The following values are allowed:

  * ``fdatasync``: 
    use ``fsync()`` to flush both the data and log files.

  * ``O_SYNC``: 
    use O_SYNC to open and flush the log files; use ``fsync()`` to flush the data files.

  * ``O_DIRECT``: 
    use O_DIRECT to open the data files and fsync() system call to flush both the data and log files.

  * ``O_DIRECT_NO_FSYNC``:
    use O_DIRECT to open the data files but don't use ``fsync()`` system call to flush both the data and log files. This option isn't suitable for *XFS* file system.

  * ``ALL_O_DIRECT``: 
    use O_DIRECT to open both data and log files, and use ``fsync()`` to flush the data files but not the log files. This option is recommended when |InnoDB| log files are big (more than 8GB), otherwise there might be even a performance degradation. **Note**: When using this option on *ext4* filesystem variable :variable:`innodb_log_block_size` should be set to 4096 (default log-block-size in *ext4*) in order to avoid the ``unaligned AIO/DIO`` warnings.


.. variable:: innodb_log_checksum_algorithm

   :Version Info: - :rn:`5.6.14-62.0` - Variable introduced
   :cli: Yes
   :conf: Yes
   :scope: Global
   :Dyn: Yes
   :vartype: Enumeration
   :default: ``innodb``
   :allowed: ``none``, ``innodb``, ``crc32``, ``strict_none``, ``strict_innodb``, ``strict_crc32``

This variable is used to specify how log checksums are generated and verified. Behavior of :variable:`innodb_log_checksum_algorithm` depending on its value is mostly identical to :variable:`innodb_checksum_algorithm`, except that the former applies to log rather than page checksums. **NOTE**: this feature is currently considered experimental.

The following values are allowed:

  * ``none``:
    means that a constant value will be written to log blocks instead of calculated checksum values and no checksum validation will be performed on InnoDB/XtraBackup recovery, or changed page tracking (if enabled).

  * ``innodb``:
    (the default) means the default |InnoDB| behavior -- a custom and inefficient algorithm is used to calculate log checksums, but logs created with this option are compatible with upstream |MySQL| and earlier |Percona Server| or |Percona XtraBackup| versions that do not support other log checksum algorithms.

  * ``crc32``:
    will use CRC32 for log block checksums. Checksums will also benefit from hardware acceleration provided by recent Intel CPUs.

  * ``strict_*``:
    Normally, |XtraDB| or |Percona XtraBackup| will tolerate checksums created with other algorithms than is currently specified with the :variable:`innodb_log_checksum_algorithm` option. That is, if checksums don't match when reading the redo log on recovery, the block is considered corrupted only if no algorithm produces the value matching the checksum stored in the log block header. This can be disabled by prepending the value with the ``strict_`` suffix, e.g. ``strict_none``, ``strict_crc32`` or ``strict_innodb`` will only accept checksums created using the corresponding algorithms, but not the other ones. To ensure that any log data written using the previous algorithm is fully overwritten before strictness becomes effective following migration procedure to a strict log block checksum should be used: 

    - note the current LSN;

    - set the log block checksum algorithm to the non-strict version of the desired algorithm;

    - wait until the current LSN advances to at least the previous LSN + log capacity;

    - set the log block checksum algorithm to the strict version of the desired algorithm.
