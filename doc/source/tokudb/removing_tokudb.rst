 Removing TokuDB storage engine
================================

In case you want remove the TokuDB storage engine from *Percona Server for MySQL* without causing any errors, the following is the recommended procedure:

Change the tables from TokuDB to InnoDB
---------------------------------------

If you still need the data in the TokuDB tables you must alter the tables to another supported storage engine, i.e., InnoDB:

.. code-block:: mysql

   mysql> ALTER TABLE City ENGINE=InnoDB;

.. note:: 

   If you remove the TokuDB storage engine before you have changed your tables to another supported storage engine, you won't be able to access that data without re-installing the TokuDB storage engine.

Removing the plugins
--------------------

One option is to remove the TokuDB storage engine with all installed plugins by running the ``ps-admin`` script:

.. code-block:: bash

  ps-admin --disable-tokudb -uroot -pPassw0rd

The script output should look like this: 

.. code-block:: bash

  Checking if Percona server is running with jemalloc enabled...
  >> Percona server is running with jemalloc enabled.

  Checking transparent huge pages status on the system...
  >> Transparent huge pages are currently disabled on the system.

  Checking if thp-setting=never option is already set in config file...
  >> Option thp-setting=never is set in the config file.

  Checking TokuDB plugin status...
  >> TokuDB plugin is installed.

  Removing thp-setting=never option from /etc/mysql/my.cnf
  >> Successfully removed thp-setting=never option from /etc/mysql/my.cnf

  Uninstalling TokuDB plugin...
  >> Successfully uninstalled TokuDB plugin.

.. note:: 
    The ps-admin removal may not restore the Transparent Huge Pages (THP) to the original operating system default state. You may have the following result:

    ..  code-block:: bash

        $ cat /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
        always madvise [never]

    On many operating systems, the default state is ``[always]``. To enable transparent huge pages, run the following:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ echo always > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled

Another option is to manually remove the TokuDB storage engine with all installed plugins:

.. code-block:: mysql

 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb; 
 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_file_map;
 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_fractal_tree_info;
 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_fractal_tree_block_map;
 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_trx;
 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_locks;
 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_lock_waits;
 UNINSTALL PLUGIN tokudb_background_job_status;

After the engine and the plugins have been uninstalled you can remove the TokuDB package by using the apt/yum commands: 

.. code-block:: bash

 [root@centos ~]# yum remove Percona-Server-tokudb-57.x86_64

or

.. code-block:: bash

 root@wheezy:~# apt remove percona-server-tokudb-5.7
 
.. note::

   Make sure you've removed all the TokuDB specific variables from your configuration file (:file:`my.cnf`) before you restart the server, otherwise server could show errors or warnings and won't be able to start.
