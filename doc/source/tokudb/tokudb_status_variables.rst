TokuDB Status Variables
=======================

TokuDB status variables provide details about the inner workings of TokuDB
storage engine and they can be useful in tuning the storage engine to a
particular environment. 

You can view these variables and their values by running:

.. code-block:: mysql

  mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'tokudb%';

purpose due to layers of open/close caching on top.

.. variable:: Tokudb_DB_CLOSES

This variable shows the number of times an individual PerconaFT dictionary file

debugging purposes only and not a useful value for a normal user.

.. variable:: Tokudb_CHECKPOINT_LAST_BEGAN

This variable shows the time the last checkpoint began. If a checkpoint is
currently in progress, then this time may be later than the time the last
checkpoint completed. If no checkpoint has ever taken place, then this value
will be ``Dec 31, 1969`` on Linux hosts.

this lock for a brief period.

.. variable:: Tokudb_CHECKPOINT_CLIENT_WAIT_ON_CS

This variable shows the number of times a non-checkpoint client thread waited
for the checkpoint-safe lock. This is the lock taken when you ``SET
tokudb_checkpoint_lock=1``. If a client trying to lock/postpone the

wait time will be reflected here and summed. This is not a useful metric as
regular users should never be manipulating the checkpoint lock.

evaluates to 1, the higher the cache pressure.

.. variable:: Tokudb_CACHETABLE_SIZE_CLONED

This variable shows the amount of memory, in bytes, currently used for cloned
nodes. During the checkpoint operation, dirty nodes are cloned prior to
serialization/compression, then written to disk. After which, the memory for
the cloned block is returned for re-use.

.. variable:: Tokudb_CACHETABLE_EVICTIONS

This variable shows the number of blocks evicted from cache. On its own this is
not a useful number as its impact on performance depends entirely on the
hardware and workload in use. For example, two workloads, one random, one
linear for the same starting data set will have two wildly different eviction
patterns.
