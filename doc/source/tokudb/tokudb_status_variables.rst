TokuDB Status Variables
=======================

TokuDB status variables provide details about the inner workings of TokuDB
storage engine and they can be useful in tuning the storage engine to a
particular environment. 

You can view these variables and their values by running:

.. code-block:: mysql

  mysql> SHOW STATUS LIKE 'tokudb%';

the cloned block is returned for re-use.

.. _Tokudb_CACHETABLE_EVICTIONS:

.. rubric:: ``Tokudb_CACHETABLE_EVICTIONS`` 

This variable shows the number of blocks evicted from cache. On its own this is
not a useful number as its impact on performance depends entirely on the
