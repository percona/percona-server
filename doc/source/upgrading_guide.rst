*Percona Server for MySQL* In-Place Upgrading Guide: From 5.7 to 8.0
====================================================================

An in-place upgrade is performed by using existing data on the server and involves the following actions:

* Stopping the MySQL 5.7 server
* Replacing the old binaries with MySQL 8.0 binaries
* Starting the MySQL 8.0 server with the same data files.

While an in-place upgrade may not be suitable for all environments, especially those environments with many variables to consider, the upgrade should work in most cases.

The following list summarizes a number of the changes in the 8.0 series and has useful guides that can help you perform a smooth upgrade. We strongly recommend reading this information:

.. note::

   Review other `Percona blogs <https://www.percona.com/blog/>`__ that contain upgrade information. 

Implemented in release :rn:`8.0.15-5`, *Percona Server for MySQL* uses the upstream
implementation of binary log file encryption and relay log file encryption.

The :variable:`encrypt-binlog` variable is
removed, and the related command-line option `--encrypt-binlog` is not
supported. It is important to remove the `encrypt-binlog` variable from your
configuration file before you attempt to upgrade either from another release
in the *Percona Server for MySQL* 8.0 series or from *Percona Server for MySQL* 5.7. Otherwise, the server generates a boot error and reports an unknown
variable.

The implemented binary log file encryption is compatible with the older
format. The encrypted binary log file used in a previous version of MySQL 8.0
series or Percona Server for MySQL series is supported.

Before you start the upgrade process, it is recommended to make a full backup of your database. Copy the database configuration file, for example, ``my.cnf``, to another directory to save it.

.. warning::

   Do not upgrade from 5.7 to 8.0 on a crashed instance. If the server instance
   has crashed, run the crash recovery before proceeding with the upgrade.
