/*
  This header defines five atomic operations:

  my_atomic_add#(&var, what)
    'Fetch and Add'
    add 'what' to *var, and return the old value of *var

  my_atomic_fas#(&var, what)
    'Fetch And Store'
    store 'what' in *var, and return the old value of *var

  my_atomic_cas#(&var, &old, new)
    An odd variation of 'Compare And Set/Swap'
    if *var is equal to *old, then store 'new' in *var, and return TRUE
    otherwise store *var in *old, and return FALSE
    Usually, &old should not be accessed if the operation is successful.

  my_atomic_load#(&var)
    return *var

  my_atomic_store#(&var, what)
    store 'what' in *var

  '#' is substituted by a size suffix - 32, 64, or ptr
  (e.g. my_atomic_add64, my_atomic_fas32, my_atomic_casptr).

/*
  We choose implementation as follows:
  ------------------------------------
  On Windows using Visual C++ the native implementation should be
  preferrable. When using gcc we prefer the Solaris implementation
  before the gcc because of stability preference, we choose gcc
  builtins if available. If neither Visual C++ or gcc we still choose
  the Solaris implementation on Solaris (mainly for SunStudio compilers).
