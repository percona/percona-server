  A service to check if debug keyword status.

  The debug keywords are used to implement various functionality for debugging.
  See my_dbug.h for more info. One of the functionality is @ref DBUG_EXECUTE_IF.

  This service lookup_debug_keyword() is used to implement @ref DBUG_EXECUTE_IF
  for use in components. The @ref DBUG_EXECUTE_IF is implemented in
  util/debug_execute_if.h

  The usage remains the same way as used in server. E.g.,
        DBUG_EXECUTE_IF("debug point", { ...code... return false; });
