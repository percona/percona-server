.RE
.PP
The
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
Perl script is the main application used to run the MySQL test suite\&. It invokes
\fBmysqltest\fR
to run individual test cases\&.
.PP
Invoke
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
in the
mysql\-test
directory like this:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl [\fR\fB\fIoptions\fR\fR\fB] [\fR\fB\fItest_name\fR\fR\fB] \&.\&.\&.\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
Each
\fItest_name\fR
argument names a test case\&. The test case file that corresponds to the test name is
t/\fItest_name\fR\&.test\&.
.PP
For each
\fItest_name\fR
argument,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
runs the named test case\&. With no
\fItest_name\fR
arguments,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
runs all
\&.test
files in the
t
subdirectory\&.
.PP
If no suffix is given for the test name, a suffix of
\&.test
is assumed\&. Any leading path name is ignored\&. These commands are equivalent:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl mytest\fR
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl mytest\&.test\fR
shell> \fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl t/mytest\&.test\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
A suite name can be given as part of the test name\&. That is, the syntax for naming a test is:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
[\fIsuite_name\fR\&.]\fItest_name\fR[\&.\fIsuffix\fR]
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
If a suite name is given,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
looks in that suite for the test\&. The test file corresponding to a test named
\fIsuite_name\&.test_name\fR
is found in
suite/\fIsuite_name\fR/t/\fItest_name\fR\&.test\&. There is also an implicit suite name
main
for the tests in the top
t
directory\&. With no suite name,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
looks in the default list of suites for a match and runs the test in any suites where it finds the test\&. Suppose that the default suite list is
main,
binlog,
rpl, and that a test
mytest\&.test
exists in the
main
and
rpl
suites\&. With an argument of
mytest
or
mytest\&.test,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
will run
mytest\&.test
from the
main
and
rpl
suites\&.
.PP
To run a family of test cases for which the names share a common prefix, use the
\fB\-\-do\-test=\fR\fB\fIprefix\fR\fR
option\&. For example,
\fB\-\-do\-test=rpl\fR
runs the replication tests (test cases that have names beginning with
rpl)\&.
\fB\-\-skip\-test\fR
has the opposite effect of skipping test cases for which the names share a common prefix\&.
.PP
The argument for the
\fB\-\-do\-test\fR
and
\fB\-\-skip\-test\fR
options also allows more flexible specification of which tests to perform or skip\&. If the argument contains a pattern metacharacter other than a lone period, it is interpreted as a Perl regular expression and applies to test names that match the pattern\&. If the argument contains a lone period or does not contain any pattern metacharacters, it is interpreted the same way as previously and matches test names that begin with the argument value\&. For example,
\fB\-\-do\-test=testa\fR
matches tests that begin with
testa,
\fB\-\-do\-test=main\&.testa\fR
matches tests in the
main
test suite that begin with
testa, and
\fB\-\-do\-test=main\&.*testa\fR
matches test names that contain
main
followed by
testa
with anything in between\&. In the latter case, the pattern match is not anchored to the beginning of the test name, so it also matches names such as
xmainytesta\&.
.PP
As of MySQL 5\&.7, it is possible to put a list of test names in a file and have
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
run those tests, using the option
\fB\-\-do\-test\-list=\fR\fB\fIfile\fR\fR\&. The tests should be listed one per line in the file, using the fully qualified name
\fIsuite\fR\&.\fItest\fR\&. A space may be used in place of the period\&. A line beginning with
#
indicates a comment and is ignored\&.
.PP
As of MySQL 8\&.0,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
supports a
\fB\-\-do\-suite\fR
option, which is similar to
\fB\-\-do\-test\fR
but permits specifying entire suites of tests to run\&.
.PP
To perform setup prior to running tests,
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
needs to invoke
\fBmysqld\fR
with the
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR
and
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR
options\&. If MySQL was built with the compiler flag
\fB\-DDISABLE_GRANT_OPTIONS\fR, then
\fB\-\-bootstrap\fR,
\fB\-\-skip\-grant\-tables\fR, and
\fB\-\-init\-file\fR
will be disabled\&. To handle this, set the
MYSQLD_BOOTSTRAP
environment variable to the full path name of a server that has all options enabled\&.
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
will use that server to perform setup; it is not used to run the tests\&.
.PP
The
init_file
test will fail if
\fB\-\-init\-file\fR
is disabled\&. This is an expected failure in this case\&.
.PP
To run
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
on Windows, you\*(Aqll need either Cygwin or ActiveState Perl to run it\&. You may also need to install the modules required by the script\&. To run the test script, change location into the
mysql\-test
directory, set the
MTR_VS_CONFIG
environment variable to the configuration you selected earlier (or use the
\fB\-\-vs\-config\fR
option), and invoke
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR\&. For example (using Cygwin and the
\fBbash\fR
shell):
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
shell> \fBcd mysql\-test\fR
shell> \fBexport MTR_VS_CONFIG=debug\fR
shell> \fB\&./mysqltest\-run\&.pl \-\-force \-\-timer\fR
shell> \fB\&./mysqltest\-run\&.pl \-\-force \-\-timer \-\-ps\-protocol\fR
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.PP
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
uses several environment variables\&. Some of them are listed in the following table\&. Some of these are set from the outside and used by
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR, others are set by
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
instead, and may be referred to in tests\&.

The variable
MTR_PORT_BASE
is a more logical replacement for the original variable
MTR_BUILD_THREAD\&. It gives the actual port number directly (will be rounded down to a multiple of 10)\&. If you use
MTR_BUILD_THREAD, the port number is found by multiplying this by 10 and adding 10000\&.
.PP
Tests sometimes rely on certain environment variables being defined\&. For example, certain tests assume that
MYSQL_TEST
is defined so that
\fBmysqltest\fR
can invoke itself with
exec $MYSQL_TEST\&.
.PP
Other tests may refer to the last three variables listed in the preceding table, to locate files to read or write\&. For example, tests that need to create files will typically put them in
$MYSQL_TMP_DIR/\fIfile_name\fR\&.
.PP
The variable
$MYSQLD_CMD
will include any server options added with the
\fB\-\-mysqld\fR
option to
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR, but will not include server options added specifically for the currently running test\&.
.PP
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
supports the options in the following list\&. An argument of
\fB\-\-\fR
tells
\fBmysql\-test\-run\&.pl\fR
not to process any following arguments as options\&.
