Before MySQL 5\&.7\&.5,

\fBmysql_install_db\fR

When

generates a random password for the administrative account, it is necessary after
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
has been run to start the server, connect using the administrative account with the password written to the
\&.mysql_secret
file, and specify a new administrative password\&. Until this is done, the administrative account cannot be used for anything else\&. To change the password, you can use the
SET PASSWORD
statement (for example, with the
\fBmysql\fR
or
\fBmysqladmin\fR
client)\&. After resetting the password, remove the
\&.mysql_secret
file; otherwise, if you run
\fBmysql_secure_installation\fR, that command may see the file and expire the
root
password again as part of ensuring secure deployment\&.

Because the MySQL server,

\fB\-\-user\fR
option to indicate the user name that
\fBmysqld\fR
will run as\&. It might be necessary to specify other options such as
\fB\-\-basedir\fR
if
\fBmysql_install_db\fR

After
\fBmysql_install_db\fR
sets up the
InnoDB
system tablespace, changes to some tablespace characteristics require setting up a whole new

innodb_data_file_path
and
innodb_log_file_size
configuration parameters are in place in the MySQL
configuration file
before running
\fBmysql_install_db\fR\&. Also make sure to specify as necessary other parameters that affect the creation and location of
InnoDB
files, such as
innodb_data_home_dir
and
innodb_log_group_home_dir\&.

If those options are in your configuration file but that file is not in a location that MySQL reads by default, specify the file location using the
