# Bug#33732907: Slow query log logs password in plain text on syntax error

# This succeeds, and the password is correctly obfuscated.
CREATE USER 'duplicate_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
# This fails, but the password is still correctly obfuscated.
CREATE USER 'duplicate_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';
ERROR HY000: Operation CREATE USER failed for 'duplicate_user'@'%'

# Since we throw an error during the parse stage, we don't know which
# part of the statement is the password (or whether there even is one),
# so we cannot obfuscate it. In that case, the statement should not be
# logged, either. The general log also behaves like this by default.
