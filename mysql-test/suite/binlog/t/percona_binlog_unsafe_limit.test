# ==== Purpose ====
#
# Test under what circumstances there is a warning for unsafe
# statements on the following form:
#
# [INSERT...SELECT | REPLACE...SELECT | DELETE | UPDATE] ... ORDER BY ... LIMIT
#
# INSERT...SELECT...LIMIT should give a warning because the order of
# rows may differ between master and slave, so the LIMIT may select a
# different set of rows on master and slave.  However, if there is an
# 'ORDER BY primary_key', then the order is known and there should not
# be any warning.  The same is true for REPLACE...SELECT, DELETE, and
# UPDATE.  In REPLACE...SELECT and INSERT...SELECT, the select may be
# compound using UNION or JOIN or subqueries in the FROM clause.  So
# we test LIMIT in various places in the subqueries.
#
# We also test various forms of ORDER BY ... LIMIT. If there is one
# ORDER BY column and it is a PRIMARY KEY or NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY, then
# the order is deterministic.  If there is one ORDER BY column and it
# is neither a PRIMARY KEY nor a NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY, then the order
# is not deterministic.  If the ORDER BY consists of several columns,
# and a prefix of the ORDER BY columns is a PRIMARY KEY or NOT NULL
# UNIQUE KEY, then the order is deterministic.  If the ORDER BY
# consists of several columns, and no prefix of the ORDER BY COLUMNS
# is a PRIMARY KEY or NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY, then the order is not
# deterministic.

# Create the tables for test
# Where:

#    - pk is column of the primary key
#    - nuk is a column of UNIQUE KEY, which can be NULL.
#    - nnuk is a column of NOT NULL UNIQUE KEY
#    - nnuk1 and nnuk2 are NOT NULL columns, and togather forms a UNIQUE KEY.
#    - nnuk_str_long is a VARCHAR UNIQUE KEY column that is longer than MAX_LENGTH_SORT in this test.
#    - nnuk_str_short is a VARCHAR UNIQUE KEY column that is shorter than MAX_LENGTH_SORT in this test.
