# Validate that list of senders is updated when a replica has two configured
# groups
#
# Test:
#   0. The test requires 5 servers:
#        server1: group A primary
#        server2: group A secondary
#        server3: group B primary
#        server4: group B secondary
#        server5: single server
#   1. Deploy a 1 member group A in single primary mode.
#   2. Deploy a 1 member group B in single primary mode.
#   3. Configure replica to manage the asynchronous connection
#      to groups A and B.
#   4. Create and start the managed channel.
#   5. Add secondary member to group A and validate is added to list of senders
#   6. Add secondary member to group B and validate is added to list of senders
#   7. Remove secondary member from group B and validate is removed from
#      list of senders
#   8. Remove secondary member from group A and validate is removed from
