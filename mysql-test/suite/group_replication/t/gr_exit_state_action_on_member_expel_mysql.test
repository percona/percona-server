#
# group_replication_exit_state_action sysvar specifies which action is taken by
# a server once it has involuntarily left the group. Currently there are only
# two actions: either the server continues running but with super_read_only
# enabled (READ_ONLY) or it aborts (ABORT_SERVER).
#
# In order to verify the expected behaviour, this test shall test that the
# specified exit action is executed correctly after an expel by the other
# members of the group.
#
# Test:
# 0) Setup group of 3 members (M1, M2 and M3).
# 1) Force expel of member 1.
# 1.1) Verify that member 1 went to super_read_only mode.
# 2) Relaunch member 1 with exit state action to ABORT_SERVER.
# 3) Force expel again of member 1.
# 3.1) Verify that member 1 aborted.
# 4) Relaunch member 1.
# 5) Cleanup.
