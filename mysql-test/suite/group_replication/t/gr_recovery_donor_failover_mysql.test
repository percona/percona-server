# Recovery donor failover test
# This test focus on the failover mechanism where a joiner changes it's donor
# whenever the one in use leaves the group while recovery is happening.
#
# To test this, a new member is started but recovery blocked. While at this state
# the donor is killed, forcing the joiner to change to a new one. As there is
# no donor identification as of now, we just unblock and check that recovery
# was successful
#
# Test:
# 0. The test requires three servers: M1, M2 and M3.
# 1. Bootstrap group on M1. Insert some data. Start GR on M2.
# 2. Stop the applier on both servers to block recovery.
# 3. Start GR on M3. It should go into RECOVERING state. Identify the DONOR.
# 4. Stop GR on the donor making it leave the group.
# 5. Unblock recovery i.e. Start the applier on failover member and watch M3 go
#    ONLINE despite the donor exit. Vaidate data on M3.
# 6. Clean up.
