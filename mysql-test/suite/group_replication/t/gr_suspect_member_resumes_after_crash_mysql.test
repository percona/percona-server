# WL11570 - GR: options to defer member eviction after a suspicion
#
# In a group of 3 servers, we crash one of them, restart it and make it join the group
# again, which fails. When it finally is expelled from the group, as its suspicion
# on other members times out, it is finally able to rejoin the group.
# Test :
# 0. This test requires a group with 3 servers.
# 1. Set the group_replication_member_expel_timeout parameter to 3600 seconds.
# 2. Create table t1 and insert some data, checking that it is replicated to all
#    servers.
# 3. Crash server 3 and it will restart.
#    This will make server 3 not answer to "I am alive" GCS messages and it will
#    eventually be considered faulty.
# 4. Check that all members are still in the group on servers 1 and 2, which should
#    both be ONLINE.
#    Server 3 should still be in the group but UNREACHABLE.
# 5. Insert data into table t1 on server 2 and check that it is replicated to server 1.
# 6. Restart GR on server 3 and it should fail since its
#    suspicion still hasn't timed out on other members.
# 7. Wait until server 3 is expelled from the group.
# 8. Server 3 was expelled! Start GR on server 3.
# 9. Check that server 3 retrieves the data inserted while
#    it was suspended. Then, use it to insert new data into
#    table t1 which should be replicated to servers 1 and 2.
# 10. Clean up.
