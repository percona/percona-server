# Bug 53588 test case.
#
# Create long enough index (between 1000 and 3500). 1000 is the old value,
# 3500 is innodb value (see ha_innobase::max_supported_key_length()). Without
# the fix the test will fail with "Specified key was too long" error.
#
# For 8.0 the actual key length is counted as a value from statement,
# multiplied by the maximum symbol lenght of the key's charset.
#
--source include/have_blackhole.inc

# As default test charset is UTF-8 with 4-byte maximum symbol length, the `a`
# key length will be multiplied by 4 (750*4 = 3000) and compared with what
# blackhole storage engine returns from
# ha_blackhole::max_supported_key_length(), that is why we need to reduce
# the initial key length (3000) by 4 times to pass the test.
CREATE TABLE `t` (
  `a` varchar(750) NOT NULL default '',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`a`)
) ENGINE=BLACKHOLE;

DROP TABLE `t`;
