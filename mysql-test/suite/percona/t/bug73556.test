# Public / Internal Oracle Bug #73556 / #19434916
# Although the bug was fixed in MySQL Server 5.5.47, the test case was never added.
# Here is an excerpt from the release notes: 
#  * A server exit could occur when updating a view using an ALL comparison operator on a subquery
#    that selects from an indexed column in the main table. (Bug #19434916)

CREATE TABLE t1(a DECIMAL NOT NULL) ENGINE=InnoDB;

CREATE TABLE t2(
  b INT,
  c INT UNSIGNED NOT NULL,
  d FLOAT,
  PRIMARY KEY(b)
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
CREATE VIEW v AS SELECT * FROM t2;
INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (1, 0, 0);

UPDATE v SET d=3 WHERE c < ALL(SELECT b FROM t1);

DROP VIEW v;
DROP TABLE t1, t2;
