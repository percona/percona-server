# Test for bug 76277.
# With LOCK TABLES in force, an attempt to open a temporary MERGE table
# consisting of a view in its list of tables (not the last table in the
# list) caused a server exit.

CREATE TABLE t2 (a INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, b VARCHAR(10), c CHAR(254)) ENGINE=MEMORY;

CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE m1 (c1 INT, c2 INT) ENGINE=MRG_MyISAM UNION=(t1,t2) INSERT_METHOD=LAST;
