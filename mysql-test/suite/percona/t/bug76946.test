# Bug 76946. The updatable property of a view is set during view creation.
# If the underlying table was dropped and re-created as a nonupdatable one,
# the updatable property of the original view was not revised
# accordingly. This could cause a server exit for attempts to insert or
# replace into the view is made. (This problem was specific to views
# with multiple tables/views and did not occur with update statements.)

CREATE TABLE t1(a INT KEY) ENGINE=innodb ROW_FORMAT=compressed;
CREATE VIEW v1 AS SELECT t1a.* FROM t1,t1 AS t1a;
DROP TABLE t1;
CREATE VIEW t1 AS SELECT 1 AS a;
--error ER_NON_INSERTABLE_TABLE
REPLACE v1 SET a=10;
DROP VIEW t1;
DROP VIEW v1;
