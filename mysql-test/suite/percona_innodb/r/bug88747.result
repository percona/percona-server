# Bug #27216817 / #88747 "InnoDB: Failing assertion: prebuilt->table->n_mysql_handles_opened == 1"
# fixed in 5.5.60, 5.6.40, 5.7.22, 8.0.11
# Adding a unique index to an InnoDB table on which multiple locks were
# held could raise an assertion
#
CREATE TABLE t1(
c1 INT NOT NULL,
c2 TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
c3 INT NULL,
c4 CHAR(1) NOT NULL
) ENGINE=InnoDB;
LOCK TABLES t1 WRITE, t1 AS a READ;
ALTER TABLE t1 ADD PRIMARY KEY(c1);
UNLOCK TABLES;
DROP TABLE t1;
