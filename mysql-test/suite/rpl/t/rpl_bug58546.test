--echo # Bug#58546 test rpl_packet timeout failure sporadically on PB
--echo # ----------------------------------------------------------------------
--echo # STOP SLAVE stopped IO thread first and then stopped SQL thread. It was
--echo # possible that IO thread stopped after replicating part of a transaction
--echo # which SQL thread was executing. SQL thread would be hung if the
--echo # transaction could not be rolled back safely.
--echo # It caused some sporadic failures on PB2.
--echo #
--echo # This test verifies that when 'STOP SLAVE' is issued by a user, IO
--echo # thread will continue to fetch the rest events of the transaction which
--echo # is being executed by SQL thread and is not able to be rolled back safely.
