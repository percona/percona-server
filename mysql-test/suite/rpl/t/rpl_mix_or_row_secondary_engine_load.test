# The aim of this test is to set up replication between a master    #
# and slave and check that the new ALTER TABLE syntax that has      #
# been introduced in WL#11581 and WL#11581 to support secondary     #
# engines work as expected. A mock engine has been written to test  #
# the statements.                                                   #
