# Bug #1268735:
# Slave I/O thread won't attempt to automatically reconnect to the master
# on ER_NET_READ_INTERRUPTED network error.
#
# The bug is in get_master_version_and_clock(). There are two places in this
# function where the bug takes place. The first one is getting master server id
# and the second one is getting master time. The error was injected to the code
# to test the bug fix.

source include/master-slave.inc;
# The error injection works only with debug facilities.
source include/have_debug.inc;
source include/have_debug_sync.inc;
# The test is not supposed to have any binglog affairs.
# Hence it's enough it to run only with one binlog format
source include/have_binlog_format_mixed.inc;
