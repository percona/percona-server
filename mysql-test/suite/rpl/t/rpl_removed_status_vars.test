# BUG#32709065: REMOVE DEAD CODE FOR REMOVED REPLICATION STATUS VARIABLES
#
# Note: the test passes before *and* after the bugfix. The test may be
# executed without the bugfix to verify the correctness of the
# assumption of the bugfix: that the code we remove actually was not
# used.

SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Slave_running';
SHOW STATUS LIKE 'Slave_retried_transactions';
