# This test is for scenario when gtid_next variable is set to GTID value, which indicates that 
# this is replicated transaction and single DROP statement contains temporary and non-temporary tables
# Theoretically such transaction should not be logged by master. It would be split into 2 separate transactions (SBR)
# or drop of temporary table would be skipped from logging, resulting in single table DROP for non-temporary table (RBR)
# However there are still at least 2 cases when it can happen:
#
# 1. Simulate replicated transaction by invoking DROP with 2 such tables directly on slave.
# 2. Create t1, t2 as non-temporary tables on master, then replicate to slave. 
#    Next drop t1, t2 from slave and create t1, t2 on slave only using stored procedure.
#    This scenario is strange, however rpl_gtid_split_statements.test performs such scenario.
# 
# If slave uses RBL, droping of temporary table will not be logged, so single table drop of non-temporary table will 
# go to slave's binlog.
# If slave uses SBL, case 1 above will issue the error (2 tables would be logged to binlog,
# but as separate transactions using the same GTID, which is not allowed).
# If slave uses SBL, case 2 will still work, as temporary tables created by stored procedures are not logged
# even if SBL is used.
