# Bug #18740222 / #75943 "handle_fatal_signal (sig=11) in get_interval_info"
# fixed in 5.5.50, 5.6.31, 5.7.13, 5.8.0
# Some string functions returned one or a combination of their parameters as
# their result. If one of the parameters had a non-ASCII character set, the
# result string had the same character set, resulting in incorrect behavior
# when an ASCII string was expected.
