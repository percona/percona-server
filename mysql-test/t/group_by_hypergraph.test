# This should have been a unit test in hypergraph_optimizer-t.cc, but
# the unit test framework does not currently allow creating temporary
# tables.
#
# We want to test that the hypergraph optimizer doesn't try to do
# sort-ahead on an aggregate.
#
# We expect the hypergraph optimizer to set up a plan like this:
#
# -> Remove duplicates from input grouped on t.x, `MIN(t2.x)`
#   -> Stream results
#       -> Group aggregate: min(t2.x)
#           -> Sort: t2.x
#               -> Inner hash join (t1.x = t2.x)
#                   -> Table scan on t1
#                   -> Hash
#                       -> Table scan on t2
#
# Before, it would set up this plan, which tried to sort on MIN(t2.x)
# before the aggregation had happened:
#
# -> Remove duplicates from input grouped on t1.x, min(t2.x)
#   -> Stream results
#       -> Group aggregate: min(t2.x)
#           -> Sort: t1.x, min(t2.x)
#               -> Inner hash join (t1.x = t2.x)
#                   -> Table scan on t1
#                   -> Hash
#                       -> Table scan on t2
#
# Note that because MIN(t2.x) is functionally dependent on the GROUP BY
# expression (which happens to be t2.x as well here), we avoid a sort
# in the final DISTINCT pass. We further shuffle the SELECT expressions
# around a bit (putting the MIN() first) to demonstrate that our sorting of
# expressions in an interesting grouping is robust.
#
# Of course, we should have been able to remove the entire DISTINCT operation,
# and if we wrote t2.x instead of t1.x, we would be able to do that. However,
# the interesting order framework does not track uniqueness (so can not do it),
# and the hard-coded DISTINCT removal, which runs before the join optimizer,
# does not take functional dependencies into account, so it does not know that
# t1.x (in the SELECT list) = t2.x (in the GROUP BY list).
