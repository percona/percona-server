/**
  @file
  logger service

  Log file with rotation implementation.

  This service implements logging with possible rotation
  of the log files. Interface intentionally tries to be similar to FILE*
  related functions.

  So that one can open the log with logger_open(), specifying
  the limit on the logfile size and the rotations number.

  Then it's possible to write messages to the log with
  logger_printf or logger_vprintf functions.

  As the size of the logfile grows over the specified limit,
  it is renamed to 'logfile.1'. The former 'logfile.1' becomes
  'logfile.2', etc. The file 'logfile.rotations' is removed.
  That's how the rotation works.

  The rotation can be forced with the logger_rotate() call.

  Finally the log should be closed with logger_close().

@notes:
  Implementation checks the size of the log file before it starts new
  printf into it. So the size of the file gets over the limit when it rotates.

  The access is secured with the mutex, so the log is threadsafe.
